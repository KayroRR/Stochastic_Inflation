# Stochastic_Inflation
This work studies the inflaton field during early cosmic inflation using a stochastic approach. Numerical simulations with Monte Carlo and Markov methods show that quantum fluctuations behave as stochastic noise, leading to slow-roll dynamics and Gaussian distributions consistent with standard inflationary models.
