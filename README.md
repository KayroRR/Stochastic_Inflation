# Stochastic Inflation
Early cosmic inflation represents one of the most significant phenomena in the history of the universe, responsible for the accelerated expansion that shaped its large-scale structure. Therefore, this work studies the behavior of the inflaton field —the scalar field driving such expansion— by treating its quantum fluctuations as a stochastic process. Through numerical simulations based on Monte Carlo and Markov chain methods, the evolution of the field under different initial conditions is analyzed by solving the Langevin and Fokker–Planck equations. The results show that quantum fluctuations can be properly modeled as stochastic noise and that the inflaton dynamics tend toward a gradual deceleration regime (slow-roll), reaching a stationary state. Likewise, the probability distributions of the field and its conjugate momentum exhibit a Gaussian character, consistent with the predictions of standard inflationary models. Overall, this study validates the stochastic approach as a tool to explore quantum effects in cosmology and establishes a connection between theory and potential observable imprints in the cosmic microwave background, with a view toward future extensions that, through greater computational power, will allow for more precise comparisons between numerical predictions and real cosmological data.
